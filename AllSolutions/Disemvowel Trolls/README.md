# Condition And Task
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

## Example
"This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"

## Note
"**y**" isn't considered a vowel.
